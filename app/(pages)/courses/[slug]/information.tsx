                IVF is complicated and-while we wish we could say that it&apos;s
                possible to absorb all the details during the 5-30 minute visits
                with your doctor-that&apos;s really not the case. This
                comprehensive guide to IVF boils down every major issue
                you&apos;ll encounter-a high level overview of the IVF process,
                a deeper dive into the IVF process, IVF success rates and how
                they differ depending on diagnosis and age, the medication
                protocols that can be used during IVF, the choice of
                inseminating eggs either using ICSI fertilization or
                conventional insemination, the pros and cons of growing embryos
                to Day 3 cleavage stage or Day 5 blastocyst stage, the decisions
                around genetic screening of embryos, deciding which embryo to
                transfer, deciding how many embryos to transfer at once, the
                ways the IVF laboratory can impact your odds of success and the
                things you need to know up front to avoid going to the wrong lab
                for you, the risks of IVF, and the costs of IVF. We&apos;re
                always sure to provide details about how data might be different
                depending on unique types of patients-because in the world of
                fertility, it&apos;s really not one-size-fits-all. We truly
                believe this guide is the foundation every fertility patient
                should start with when they&apos;re navigating the world of
                treatments.
